Suma Order
==========

A simple Rails app 'shopping basket' for a community SUMA food group
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- The user uses Suma_Order to browse the products available in the current SUMA Catalog, select some to
order, and supply the information needed to create an order.
- The admin uses Suma_Order to maintain a list of products to offer, to determine the
orders that are awaiting collection, and to send formatted order to SUMA.
